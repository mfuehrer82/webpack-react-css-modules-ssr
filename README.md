## Prerequisites

* Unix like System (e.g. Mac, Ubuntu)
* Node.js `>= 6.0.0`
* NPM `>= 3.0.0`

## Execute

Install the application:

```sh
npm install
```

Then first start the express server:

```sh
npm start
```

This creates [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you can access
the site.

You can also start in another terminal (after `npm start`) browser sync
and file watch in another terminal **without autoreload** (I'm working
on it to reduce it to one task):

```sh
npm run watch
```

This creates the [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) and a network url.
